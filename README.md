# Studying Monads in Scala

Some practice with the topics explained in the article [You Could Have Invented Monads!](1)

These exercises are aimed at understanding how monads got developed and the concepts that lie underneath them.
  
Following the page, here are developed 3 monads:

- Writer
- List
- State 

Each exercise is structured such that monads arise as a generalization of a
common problem.
First a problem is presented in the form of "I have two functions to wire
together with some code" and then, via a series of steps, the exercise tries to
solve the problem via auxiliary function, generalization and abstraction until
we reach a very generic solution: a monad.
