/**
  * Store Comonad (with simplified internal structure for simplicity)
  *
  * This models a "store" of values of type A indexed by the type S. We have the
  * ability to directly access the A value under a given S using peek, and there
  * is a distinguished cursor or current position. The comonadic extract just
  * reads the value under the cursor, and duplicate gives us a whole store full
  * of stores such that if we peek at any one of them, we get a Store whose
  * cursor is set to the given s. Weâ€™re defining a seek(s) operation that moves
  * the cursor to a given position s by taking advantage of duplicate.
